  <h3 style="text-align: left ;color: darkcyan;">
    -> Quantitative Aptitude<br>
    ->  Programming Language Efficiency<br>
    ->  Coding Test and<br>
    -> E-mail Writing<br>
</h3>
<h3>
  Be especially careful while attempting the email questions as that is a key elimination round.</h3>
<br>
<h2  style="color: crimson;"> Technical Interview</h2>
<img src="https://media.monsterindia.com/cmsimages/1561107868.png" style="width: 30%;height: 30%;align-items: center;">
<h3>This round is based on your resume, branch of specialization, favorite subjects, etc. Be prepared to answer basic questions relating to each of these topics. Don’t be surprised if you are asked to write code. Also be ready to answer puzzle questions.

  In certain cases, the interviewer may also try and confuse/mislead you into giving the wrong answer so watch out for such trick questions.
</h3>
<h2  style="color: crimson;">Managerial Interview
</h2>

<h3>
  A lot depends on your interviewer in this round. You could either be asked general technical and HR questions, or it could be a pressure interview to gauge your reactions. Achievements mentioned in your CV could be questioned, and you may need to defend them.

  Alternatively, you could be asked general questions about your work experience, college degree, specialization, willingness to relocate, etc. In any case, never fail to be gracious irrespective of which direction the interview takes.
</h3>
<h2 style="color: crimson;">HR Interview</h2>
<img src="https://media.monsterindia.com/cmsimages/1561107918.png" style="width: 30%;height: 30%;align-items: center;">
<h3>
  Expect questions on work experience, education, hobbies and family background apart from the usual HR questions like strengths and weaknesses, reasons for applying to the company, why you should be hired, etc.

  Most candidates tend to think that the HR interview is easy, but remember that a bad HR interview could end your chances of getting the job even after passing all the previous obstacles (aptitude test, technical round, etc.). The key here is to remain polite and confident. Interviews can be long and dreary so don’t forget to wear a smile!

  With TCS being named one of the world’s top employers by the Top Employer Institute for consecutive years, a career at this company could be rich and rewarding experience for job seekers.

  So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and apply now!
